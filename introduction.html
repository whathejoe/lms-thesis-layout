    <p>Computers in the classroom include any digital technology used to enhance, supplement, or replace a traditional educational curriculum. As computers have become more accessible, inexpensive, and powerful, the demand for this technology has increased, leading to more frequent use of computer resources within classes, and a decrease in the student-to-computer ratio within schools.</p>

    <p>It is widely accepted that the integration of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the teaching learning process has great potential. In fact, it could be the most important way by which states can meet their educational aspirations within reasonable time and resources.  The use of computers in Elementary schools is basically vision as a teaching and learning aid besides to develop computer literacy amongst the children. Computer aided learning will help us to make the present teaching learning process joyful, interesting and easy to understand through audio-visual aids. Teachers will be resourced with Multimedia Contents to explain topics better. Overall it will help us to improve quality of education in long learn.</p>

    <p>This course is designed specifically for those students who need to develop a proficiency in algebraic skills that are essential for subsequent Math courses.</p>

    <p>College Algebra provides a working foundation in the use of algebraic operations, theories, and principles. After a brief review of foundational concepts including real numbers, exponents and radical expressions, rational expressions and polynomials, College Algebra prepares students to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluate Polynomials, Special Products, Factoring Polynomials , Rational Expressions, Exponents, and Radicals;</li>
      <li>Classify and solve Systems of Linear Equations in One Variables, Systems of Linear in Two Variables, Systems of Linear in Three Variables, and Inequalities;</li>
      <li>Solve Quadratic Equations by Factoring, completing the square, and using the Quadratic Formula.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>College Algebra can be considered as the "eye opener" and the "testing ground" for the tertiary level freshmen.</p>
